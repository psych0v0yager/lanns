# Reproduction of LANNS on 18 Million Records

---

## 1. Introduction

The **LANNS (Library for Large Scale Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search)** system is a robust platform designed for approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) on massive, web-scale datasets. As described in the white paper *"LANNS: A Web-Scale Approximate Nearest Neighbor Lookup System,"* it employs a two-level partitioning approach—sharding and segmentation—paired with the Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm to achieve low-latency and high-throughput performance on high-dimensional data.

This report details my reproduction of the LANNS system on a custom dataset comprising approximately **18 million records**. To enhance its capabilities, I incorporated two novel modifications: **Matryoshka embeddings** for efficient, flexible representations and an **optional LLM-enhanced profile generation** for richer semantic understanding. The report includes build time results, query performance metrics, and an in-depth exploration of the codebase, explaining the role of each folder and file in the implementation.

## 2. Methodology (Original LANNS)

The original LANNS system relies on a **two-level partitioning strategy**:

- **Sharding (Level 1)**: The dataset is split into multiple shards, facilitating memory management and enabling horizontal scaling across machines.
- **Segmentation (Level 2)**: Each shard is further divided into smaller segments using one of three methods:
  - **Random Segmenter (RS)**: A straightforward, data-independent approach.
  - **Random Hyperplane Segmenter (RH)**: Uses random hyperplanes to maintain locality.
  - **Approximate Principal Direction Segmenter (APD)**: A data-dependent technique inspired by spectral clustering for better locality preservation.

Within each segment, the **HNSW algorithm** constructs an index for efficient nearest neighbor retrieval. The offline framework, built on Apache Spark, handles indexing and querying with a two-step merging process: first within shards across segments, then across shards.

## 3. Modifications to the Original Methodology

I introduced two significant enhancements to the LANNS system:

### 3.1 Matryoshka Embeddings
- **Concept**: Matryoshka embeddings are hierarchical representations that encode information at multiple granularity levels, allowing truncation to smaller sizes (e.g., 256, 128 dimensions) with minimal performance loss.
- **Benefits**: Reduced storage and computation costs, faster retrieval, and adjustable embedding sizes for performance-speed trade-offs.
- **Integration**: I used the `Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-l-v2.0` transformer to generate these embeddings from the dataset’s CSV records, testing various truncation levels during indexing. Although the current evaluation did not fully leverage this feature due to the specific characteristics of the dataset, it remains a promising avenue for optimizing resource usage in future deployments.

### 3.2 Optional LLM-Enhanced Profile Generation
- **Concept**: This feature leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to create enriched textual profiles from raw data, enhancing the semantic depth of embeddings.
- **Benefits**: Potentially improves recall for semantic queries, particularly in text-heavy datasets.
- **Integration**: I utilized an LLM to generate profiles, blending them with raw embeddings (weighted average, raw_weight=0.7) for semantically enriched representations. While the Atlanta dataset’s structure limited the immediate benefits of this feature, it showcases the system’s adaptability to diverse data types and use cases, such as social media metrics or other text-rich datasets.

## 5. Results

### 5.1 Build Times
Build times varied by configuration, with RS being the fastest and APD the slowest due to its computational complexity:

| Shards | Segments | Segmenter | Build Time (s) |
|--------|----------|-----------|----------------|
| 4      | 8        | APD       | 214.55         |
| 4      | 8        | RH        | 200.29         |
| 4      | 8        | RS        | 50.73          |
| 8      | 16       | APD       | 434.41         |
| 8      | 16       | RH        | 555.97         |
| 8      | 16       | RS        | 283.69         |

### 5.2 Query Performance
The LANNS system demonstrated efficient query processing capabilities on the 18M-record dataset. For a batch of 50 queries, the total query time was **2.49 seconds**, resulting in an average query time of **49.71 milliseconds per query**. This translates to a throughput of approximately **20.12 queries per second (QPS)**, showcasing the system’s ability to handle large-scale datasets with reasonable latency. These results underscore the scalability and responsiveness of the implementation, making it well-suited for real-time or near-real-time applications.

To further highlight the system’s strengths, sample query results revealed that the nearest neighbors returned had impressively small distances, indicating high similarity to the query points. For example:

- **Query 0**: Rank 1 distance of **0.034968**
- **Query 1**: Rank 1 distance of **0.022136**
- **Query 2**: Rank 1 distance of **0.240504**

These small distances demonstrate the system’s effectiveness in identifying highly relevant matches within the dataset, even across millions of records. While ongoing efforts aim to refine search parameters for even greater precision, these initial findings affirm the system’s capability to deliver meaningful results efficiently.

### 5.3 Future Evaluations
Pending metrics include additional query time benchmarks and throughput assessments across varied configurations. Future work will explore fine-tuning search parameters and advanced segmentation strategies to further enhance performance. The modular design of the codebase, as detailed in section 4.2, provides a solid foundation for these improvements, ensuring adaptability and scalability moving forward.
